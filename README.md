# DjipEvents

DjipEvents is a modularized event-handling library for the browser. It implements the _observable_
design pattern with methods such as: `on()`, `off()`, `emit()`, `once()`, etc.

This library is being primarily used in my own projects ([DjipAV](https://github.com/djipco/djipav), 
for example) and I do not intend on providing support for it. However, if you feel like using it, go 
right ahead! Use at your own risk though... ;-)

## API Reference

Since the `EventEmitter` class is an abstract class meant to be extended (or mixed in), I did not 
take time to create usage examples. However, I did take some time to create a complete 
[API Reference](https://djipco.github.io/djipevents/).
