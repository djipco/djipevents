# DjipEvents

DjipEvents is a modularized event-handling library for the browser based on the Node.js EventEmitter 
API. It is (mostly) a refactoring of Arnout Kazemier's great
[eventemitter3](https://github.com/primus/eventemitter3) as ES6 modules.

This library is being used in other projects and libraries (DjipAV, for example) and is not 
necessarily meant for general-purpose usage (i.e. I do not intend to provide any support with 
this!). Use at your own risk. :-)

## API Reference

Since the `EventEmitter` class is an abstract class meant to be extended (or mixed in), I did not 
take time to create usage examples. However, I did take the time to create a complete 
[API Reference](https://djipco.github.io/djipevents/).
